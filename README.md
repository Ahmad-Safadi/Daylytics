# ðŸ§­ Daily Activity Tracker (Terminal-Based)

A simple and interactive terminal-based Python tool that helps you reflect on how you spend your 24 hours in a day. You log your **bad** and **good** activities, and the script provides a clear summary and progress bar visualization to help you stay mindful and balanced.

## ðŸŽ® How It Works

1. You'll first enter your **bad activities** (name + hours).
2. Then, you'll enter your **good activities**.
3. The script will automatically:
   - Ensure total hours donâ€™t exceed 24.
   - Show remaining hours as you go.
   - Display a clear summary of both categories.
   - Show progress bars for time distribution.
   - Warn you if distractions outweigh productivity.
